# Yet another chess

## A simple chess game made with rust

I have created yet another chess game to try out [bevy](https://bevyengine.org) features and get into ecs architecture for game development. I will write my detailed thoughts later.

Check out the demo at [http://sammelanyogi.github.io/chess](http://sammelanyogi.github.io/chess).

### TODO

- Multiplayer support to play online

*Keep following and give me ideas/suggestions*
